1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) allow for the extension of the IPv6
   protocol, and provide support for core functionality such as IPv6
   fragmentation.  However, IPv6 Extension Headers have been deemed to
   present a challenge to IPv6 implementations and networks, and have
   been assumed/known to be intentionally dropped in some existing IPv6
   deployments.

   Discussions over the security and operational implications of IPv6
   extension headers come up over and over again at both in IETF circles
   and other venues, and not infrequently some key aspects involving
   IPv6 extension headers are overlooked.

   This document tries raise awareness about the security and
   operational implications of IPv6 Extension Headers, and the reasons
   for some network operators have opted (or not) to drop packets
   containing IPv6 Extension Headers.

   Section 2 of this document summarizes the work that has been done in
   the area of IPv6 extension headers.  Section 5 discusses the
   performance implications of IPv6 Extension Headers, while Section 4
   discusses the security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers.

2.  Previous Work on IPv6 Extension Headers

   Some of the implications of IPv6 Extension Headers have been
   discussed in IETF circles.  For example, [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop]
   discusses a rationale for which operators drop IPv6 fragments.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers                 May 2015


   [I-D.wkumari-long-headers] discusses possible issues arising from
   "long" IPv6 header chains.  [RFC7045] clarifies how intermediate
   nodes should deal with IPv6 extension headers.  [RFC7112] discusses
   the issues arising in a specific case where the IPv6 header chain is
   fragmented into two or more fragments (and formally forbids such
   case).  [I-D.kampanakis-6man-ipv6-eh-parsing] describes how
   inconsistencies in the way IPv6 packets with extension headers are
   parsed by different implementations may result in evasion of security
   controls, and presents guidelines for parsing IPv6 extension headers
   with a goal of providing a common and consistent parsing methodology
   for IPv6 implementations.  [RFC6980] analyzes the security
   implications of employing IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery
   for IPv6, and formally recommends against such usage.  Finally,
   [RFC7123] discusses how some popular RA-Guard implementations are
   subject to evasion by means of IPv6 extension headers.

   Some preliminary measurements regarding the extent to which packet
   containing IPv6 EHs are dropped n the public Internet have been
   presented in [PMTUD-Blackholes], [Gont-IEPG88], [Gont-Chown-IEPG89],
   and [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90].  [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world]
   presents more comprehensive results and documents the methodology for
   obtaining the presented results..

3.  Performance Implications

   Some IPv6 router implementations suffer from a negative performance
   impact when IPv6 Extension Headers are employed.

   In the most trivial case, a packet that includes a Hop-by-Hop Options
   header will typically go through the slow forwarding path, and be
   processed by the router's CPU.  Another case is that in which a
   router that has been configured to enforce an ACL based on upper-
   layer information (e.g., upper layer protocol or TCP Destination
   Port).  In such case, the router will need to process the entire IPv6
   header chain in order to find the required information, and this may
   cause the packet to be processed in the slow path [Cisco-EH-Cons].

   Processing a large amounts of traffic in the slow path may cause the
   router to be unable to handle the same traffic loads when compared to
   normal packets, and may result in Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios.

   We note that, for obvious reasons, the aforementioned performance
   issues may also affect other devices such as firewalls, Network
   Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), etc.  [Zack-FW-Benchmark].

4.  Security Implications

   The security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers generally fall
   into one or more of these categories:

   o  Evasion of security controls

   o  DoS due to processing requirements

   o  DoS due to implementation errors

   o  Extension Header-specific issues

   Different from IPv4, where the upper-layer protocol can be found
   after the variable-length IPv4 header, the structure of IPv6 packets
   is both more flexible and complex.  Namely, finding the upper-layer
   information may imply processing the (daisy-chain like) entire IPv6
   header chain.  This has been often overlooked, and a number of
   security devices have been found to be trivially evasible by
   inserting one or more IPv6 Extension Headers between the main IPv6
   header and the upper layer protocol.  [RFC7113] describes this issue
   for the RA-Guard case, but the same techniques can be employed for
   circumventing e.g. some IPv6 firewalls.  Additionally,
   inconsistencies in how some packets may be processed may result in
   evasion of security controls [I-D.kampanakis-6man-ipv6-eh-parsing]
   [Atlasis2014] [BH-EU-2014].

   As noted in Section 5, packets that employ IPv6 Extension Headers may
   have a negative performance impact on the handling devices.  Unless
   appropriate mitigations are put in place (e.g., packet filtering and/
   or rate-limiting), an attacker could simply send a large amount of
   IPv6 traffic employing IPv6 Extension Headers with the purpose of
   performing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

   IPv6 implementations, as virtually every piece of software, tend to
   mature over time.  While the IPv6 protocol itself (and many
   implementations) have been around for a long time already, bugs in
   IPv6 Extension Header processing have been recently found in a number
   of implementations.  Because there is currently almost no reliance on
   IPv6 Extension headers, the corresponding code paths are rarely
   exercised, and there is the potential that bugs still remain to be
   discovered in some implementations.

   Besides the general implications of IPv6 Extension Headers, each
   Extension Header tends to its own specific implications.  One
   particular case is that of the Fragment Header, which is employed to
   provide the fragmentation function in IPv6.  While many of the
   security implications of the fragmentation/reassembly mechanism are



Gont, et al.            Expires November 16, 2015               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers                 May 2015


   known from the IPv4 world, many of the related issues have crept into
   IPv6 implementations.  They range from Denial of Service attacks to
   information leakage (see e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id], [Bonica-NANOG58],
   [Atlasis2012]).

5.  Operational Implications

   There are a number of reasons for which an intermediate system may
   need to process the entire IPv6 extension header chain to find the
   layer-4 header.  Namely:

   o  Enforcing infrastructure ACLs

   o  DDoS management

   o  ECMP or other load-balancing implementation based on a hash of the
      four-tuple (src addr, dst addr, src port, dst port)

   o  Customer requests for filtering

   o  Implementation of edge-to-core customer sanitisation filters

   o  Route-processor protection

   When processing the entire IPv6 header chain would lead to slow-path
   forwarding, the only option an operation may be left with is to drop
   the corresponding packets.

6.  A possible attack vector

   The widespread drop of IPv6 packets employing IPv6 Extension Headers
   can, in some scenarios, be exploited for malicious purposes: if
   packets employing IPv6 EHs are known to be dropped on the path from
   one system (say, "A") to another (say, "B"), an attacker could cause
   packets sent from A to B to be dropped by sending a forged ICMPv6
   Packet Too Big (PTB) [RFC4443] error message to A (with a Next-Hop
   MTU smaller than 1280), such that subsequent packets from A to B
   include a fragment header (i.e., they result in atomic fragments
   [RFC6946]).

   Possible scenarios where this attack vector could be exploited
   include (but are not limited to):

   o  Communication between any two systems through to public network
      (e.g., client from/to server or server from/to server), where
      packets with IPv6 extension headers are dropped by some
      intermediate router



Gont, et al.            Expires November 16, 2015               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers                 May 2015


   o  Communication between two BGP peers employing IPv6 transport,
      where these BGP peers implement ACLs to drop IPv6 fragments (to
      avoid control-plane attacks)

   The aforementioned attack vector is exacerbated by the following
   factors:

   o  The attacker does not need to forge the IPv6 Source Address of his
      attack packets.  Hence, deployment of simple BCP38 filters will
      not help as a counter-measure.

   o  Only the IPv6 addresses of the IPv6 packet embedded in the ICMPv6
      payload need to be forged.  While one could envision filtering
      devices enforcing BCP38-style filters on the ICMPv6 payload, the
      use of extension (by the attacker) could make this difficult, if
      at all possible.

   o  Many implementations fail to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages, as recommended in Section 5.2 of
      [RFC4443] and documented in [RFC5927].  It should be noted that in
      some cases, such as when an ICMPv6 error message has (supposedly)
      been elicited by a connection-less transport protocol (or some
      other connection-less protocol being encapsulated in IPv6), it may
      be virtually impossible to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages.  And, because of IPv6 extension
      headers, the ICMPv6 payload might not even contain any useful
      information on which to perform validation checks.

   o  Upon receipt of one of the aforementioned ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
      error messages, the Destination Cache [RFC4861] is usually updated
      to reflect that any subsequent packets to such destination should
      include a Fragment Header.  This means that a single ICMPv6
      "Packet Too Big" error message might affect multiple communication
      instances (e.g., TCP connections) with such destination.

   o  A node cannot simply "just drop all incoming ICMPv6 Packet Too Big
      error messages", or else it would create a PMTUD blackhole.

   Possible mitigations for this issue include:

   o  Filtering incoming ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error messages that
      advertise a Next-Hop MTU smaller than 1280 bytes.

   o  Artificially reducing the MTU to 1280 bytes and filter incoming
      ICMPv6 PTB error messages.

   Both of these mitigations come at the expense of possibly preventing
   communication through SIIT [RFC6145] that rely on IPv6 atomic



Gont, et al.            Expires November 16, 2015               [Page 6]

   fragments (see [I-D.ietf-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation]), and
   also implies that the filtering device has the ability to filter ICMP
   PTB messages based on the contents of the MTU field.

   [I-D.ietf-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation] has recently proposed
   to deprecate the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments, and update the
   SIIT [RFC6145] such that it does not rely on ICMPv6 atomic fragments.
   Thus, any of the above mitigations would eliminate the attack vector
   without any interoperability implications.

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of IPv6 extension headers are discussed in
   Section 4.  A specific attack vector that would leverage the
   widespread filtering of packets with IPv6 EHs (along with possible
   countermeasures) is discussed in Section 6.  This document does not
   introduce any new security issues.
